This directory contains the isolated work from December 2014 when I extracted all of the new Sass variables in Basscss v4.1.7 (built by Jxnblk from the basscss rework variables) into one `variables.scss` file and began an initial vanilla customizaiton of the variable values and addition of new variables and rule assignments.
